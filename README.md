# Notes for Code

This repository is meant to provide Figures for re-analysis described in [comment](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comment?id=10.1371/annotation/c56e3273-feef-409d-aaed-9cc464e64739) for Warden et al. 2008 paper.

This also provides more extensive data / code than previously provided (although data saved was not final result in publication; paper describes subsets of genes used for re-analysis).  So, the data file mostly matches the [Drummond et al. 2006 Supplement](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/23/2/327/1118974#supplementary-data), but with extra variables related to the Coding fRNA predictions.

Please note that the scripts will produce many more files than shown in the .pdf Figures (which can be viewed within GitHub).  Also, sets of variables are commented out towards the beginning of each file (so, you will have 4 sets of variables to comment / uncommment to reproduce re-analysis in [Comment Figures C1-C10](https://github.com/cwarden45/Coding-fRNA-Comment/blob/master/Figures.pdf).

# Full Acknowledgement

I have uploaded a [PDF](https://github.com/cwarden45/Coding-fRNA-Comment/blob/master/comment.pdf) (and Word Document from which it was created).  Please use that to view the full acknowledgement.  I considered coping that over to the README, but I think the formatting is more clear in the PDF.
